<h1><strong>Skilling Module 1 | Scripting in Unity</strong></h1>
<p>Tutor: Octavian Gheorghiu</p>
<h1>Overview and purpose</h1>
<p>The class aims to introduce students to game engine scripting as a tool for design exploration and design communication. At the end of the class the students will build an app that explores an algorithm related to their design concept.</p>
<h1>Education Standards</h1>
<ol>
<li>Inspire, motivate and challenge students</li>
<li>Make productive use of assessments</li>
<li>Adapt classes to respond to strengths and needs of students</li>
</ol>
<h1><strong>Objectives</strong></h1>
<ol>
<li>Learn the necessary skills required to write and execute code</li>
<li>Learn the necessary skills to produce an app or a video game</li>
</ol>
<h1>Materials Needed</h1>
<ol>
<li>Unity Game Engine, Version 2017.2</li>
<li>Visual Studio Community 2017</li>
</ol>
<h1>Verification</h1>
<ol>
<li>All the objectives subcategories will be assessed by a small exercise that will require the students to use the newly learned skill</li>
<li>Skills development will require previous understanding of learned skills to proceed, thus showcasing when a necessary skill has yet to be learned</li>
<li>The final exercise will require the usage of most of the learned skills</li>
</ol>

<h1>Plagiarism</h1>
<p>UCL takes plagiarism very seriously and regards it as a form of fraud. The definition of plagiarism that has been adopted by the School of Continuing and Professional Studies is as follows: "Plagiarism is presenting someone else's work as though it were one's own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as one's own words quoted without quotation marks from another writer; a paraphrased passage from another writer&rsquo;s work; or facts or ideas gathered, organized, and reported by someone else, orally and/or in writing. Since plagiarism is a matter of fact, not of the student's intention, it is crucial that acknowledgement of the sources be accurate and complete. Even where there is not a conscious intention to deceive, the failure to make appropriate acknowledgement constitutes plagiarism. Penalties for plagiarism range from failure for a paper or course to dismissal from the University.</p>
<h1>Instructor</h1>
<p>Reuse and building upon ideas or code are major parts of modern software development. As a professional programmer you will never write anything from scratch. This class is structured such that all solutions are public. You are encouraged to learn from the work of your peers. I won't hunt down people who are simply copying-and-pasting solutions, because without challenging themselves, they are simply wasting their time and money taking this class.</p>
<p>Please respect the terms of use and/or license of any code you find, and if you reimplement or duplicate an algorithm or code from elsewhere, credit the original source with an inline comment.</p>
